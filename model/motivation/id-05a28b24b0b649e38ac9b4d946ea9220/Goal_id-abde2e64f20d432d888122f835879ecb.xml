    documentation="INFUSE Sales team with the collaboration of the Deal Desk and Client Success departments tirelessly work on bringing new business to the company. Their goals are aggressive this year.&#xD;&#xA;Operations need to have the capability to turn on the support of at least 50% MORE of the volume without sacrificing the product and service quality. Please think and develop the processes in your respective departments to be able to support 50% more work than you currently support. We might ask you to start supporting 30%-50% more work anytime. It is important to note that in order to achieve this goal, you should not concentrate solely on increasing the processing speed. In addition to the increased processing speed you should identify and eliminate any unnecessary work done due to inefficient workflow.&#xD;&#xA;For example, weâ€™ve touched on this topic multiple times in relation to Extra Good Leads. Make sure that these leads count is decreased significantly on CIDs that do not require such an effort and allocate this effort to those CIDs only where such leads are necessary."/>
